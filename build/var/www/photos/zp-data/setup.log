Zenphoto Setup v1.5.6 : Thu, 28 Nov 2019 20:26:43 -0500
Warn: zp-data security [is compromised] Zenphoto suggests you make the sensitive files in the zp-data folder accessable by owner only (permissions = 0600). The file permissions for setup.log are 0644 which may allow unauthorized access.
Warn: File Permissions [are loose (0666)] If file permissions are not set to strict or tighter there could be a security risk. However, on some servers Zenphoto does not function correctly with tight file permissions. If Zenphoto has permission errors, run setup again and select a more relaxed permission.Set File permissions to 	readonly (0444)	strict (0644)	relaxed (0664)	loose (0666)apply.
Setting permissions (0666) for Zenphoto package.
Warn: Server seems to be nginx If you wish to create cruft-free URLs, you will need to configuring URL rewriting for NGINX servers. You can ignore this warning if you do not intend to set the mod_rewrite option.
Setting permissions (0444) for albums.
Notice: failed setting permissions (0444) for cache.
Setting permissions (0444) for cache_html.
